Don't Sleep - System Sleep Prevention Application

A utility application that prevents the system from entering sleep mode by 
simulating periodic user activity through volume control key presses.

The application runs in an infinite loop, pressing the volume down and up keys
at regular intervals to keep the system active and prevent it from sleeping.

Usage:
    Run the script and it will continuously generate activity. Close the 
    terminal to exit the application.
